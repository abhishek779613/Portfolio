üöÄ Abhishek Marathe - Full Stack Developer Portfolio

This is the personal portfolio of Full Stack Developer Abhishek Marathe, designed to showcase projects, skills, and professional experience in an engaging and highly aesthetic manner.

‚ú® Project Overview

This repository hosts a single-page portfolio built using pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The core feature is a modern, dark theme with a distinct neon/glow aesthetic and smooth, responsive animations, ensuring an impactful and memorable user experience.

Key Features

Neon Aesthetic: A visually striking dark theme utilizing custom CSS variables for vibrant cyan and magenta glow effects (--main-color, --second-color).

Fully Responsive: Designed with a mobile-first approach using CSS Media Queries to ensure flawless viewing on all device sizes.

Smooth Animations: Includes custom CSS keyframe animations for the hero section (slide-in effects, spinning neon ring) and interactive elements.

Vanilla JS Interactivity: Features a dynamic typing effect in the hero section for a modern touch.

Modular Sections: Structured into clearly defined sections: Home, About, Services, Skills (with progress bars), Projects, and Contact.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

This project deliberately avoids reliance on external frameworks, demonstrating core proficiency in web fundamentals:

HTML5: Semantic and accessible document structure.

CSS3 (Custom): All styling is written using native CSS, custom properties, and keyframe animations to achieve the unique neon aesthetic.

JavaScript (Vanilla): Used for simple client-side interactions, such as the dynamic text typing effect and managing the navigation's active state.

External Assets: Utilizes Google Fonts (Poppins) and Font Awesome for icons.

üé® Customization

Personal Information: Update the text in the <section class="home"> and <section class="about"> sections.

Profile Image: Replace MyProfile.png in the home-img div with your own image, or update the src attribute with a path or URL.

Skills: Modify the percentage values (style="width: X%;") within the progress-line span elements in the Skills section.

Social Links: Update the href values in the social-media links to point to your profiles.

Color Scheme: You can easily adjust the entire neon theme by changing the values in the CSS :root block:

:root {
    --main-color: #00eaff; /* Try a different primary color */
    --second-color: #ee00ff; /* Try a different accent color */
    /* ... other colors ... */
}
